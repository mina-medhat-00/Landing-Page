          <h2>Background</h2>
          <p>
            Worldwide, insomnia remains a highly prevalent public health
            problem. eHealth presents a novel opportunity to deliver effective,
            accessible, and affordable insomnia treatments on a population-wide
            scale. However, there is no quantitative integration of evidence
            regarding the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial
            interventions on insomnia.

          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
            We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial
            interventions for insomnia and investigate the influence of specific
            study characteristics and intervention features on these effects.

          <h2>Methods</h2>
          <p>
            We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the
            Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database
            inception to February 16, 2021, for publications investigating
            eHealth-based psychosocial interventions targeting insomnia and
            updated the search of PubMed to December 6, 2021. We also screened
            gray literature for unpublished data. Eligible studies were
            randomized controlled trials of eHealth-based psychosocial
            interventions targeting adults with insomnia. Random-effects
            meta-analysis models were used to assess primary and secondary
            outcomes. Primary outcomes were insomnia severity and sleep quality.
            Meta-analyses were performed by pooling the effects of eHealth-based
            psychosocial interventions on insomnia compared with inactive and
            in-person conditions. We performed subgroup analyses and
            metaregressions to explore specific factors that affected the
            effectiveness. Secondary outcomes included sleep diary parameters
            and mental health-related outcomes.

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            Of the 19,980 identified records, 37 randomized controlled trials
            (13,227 participants) were included. eHealth-based psychosocial
            interventions significantly reduced insomnia severity (Hedges
            g=-1.01, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.89; P<.001) and improved sleep quality
            (Hedges g=-0.58, 95% CI -0.75 to -0.41; P<.001) compared with
            inactive control conditions, with no evidence of publication bias.
            We found no significant difference compared with in-person treatment
            in alleviating insomnia severity (Hedges g=0.41, 95% CI -0.02 to
            0.85; P=.06) and a significant advantage for in-person treatment in
            enhancing sleep quality (Hedges g=0.56, 95% CI 0.24-0.88; P<.001).
            eHealth-based psychosocial interventions had significantly larger
            effects (P=.01) on alleviating insomnia severity in clinical samples
            than in subclinical samples. eHealth-based psychosocial
            interventions that incorporated guidance from trained therapists had
            a significantly greater effect on insomnia severity (P=.05) and
            sleep quality (P=.02) than those with guidance from animated
            therapists or no guidance. Higher baseline insomnia severity and
            longer intervention duration were associated with a larger reduction
            in insomnia severity (P=.004). eHealth-based psychosocial
            interventions significantly improved each secondary outcome.

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>
            eHealth interventions for insomnia are effective in improving sleep
            and mental health and can be considered a promising treatment for
            insomnia. Our findings support the wider dissemination of eHealth
            interventions and their further promotion in a stepped-care model.
            Offering blended care could improve treatment effectiveness. Future
            research needs to elucidate which specific intervention components
            are most important to achieve intervention effectiveness. Blended
            eHealth interventions may be tailored to benefit people with low
            socioeconomic status, limited access to health care, or lack of
            eHealth literacy.
